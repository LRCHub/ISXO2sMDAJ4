I'm waitin on
a text from the job
a future in the moon gets the pride hot
Cheese you are so sugar
Viva viva Lone Star dope
We bend down, side to side
in the last garden of hope
You and me could be flyin
But my militia don't got a flag

I know ya wanna come around
ready or not
oh child we'll be white on white
and if not, well you gotta shoot me up with
the last damn gun in town

I'm leakin all
over the cot
trouble in the shelter when the bag's hot
I'll eat your race for supper
Viva viva American hope
I bend down
side to side
I won't be pushed shoved or pulled
I need divine right
When I'm violent on wine

Gone in seconds
Your color was love's sun
Way back in time
When time was mine
