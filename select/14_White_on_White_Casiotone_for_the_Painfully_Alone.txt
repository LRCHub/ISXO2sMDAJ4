In my dream last night everything was so bright
I could barely make you out through the light
In my dream last night there was no sound to your sight
& all your comforts were subtitled white on white

Put a penny on a railroad track
For you to pick up on your way back
How can it be that you are gone to stay

In my dream last night anything that you'd write
Would unravel & lift like a mist out of sight
But in my dream last night I guess you seemed alright
You weren't scared or anything

Put a penny on a railroad track
For you to pick up on your way back
How can it be that you are gone to stay

All the rain on the day that you died
I've never seen the reservoir so high
I guess this is as close as it gets to goodbye
